# Image Gallery with Slideshows
Create an image gallery with some interactive features.
Demo: https://aoyingxue.github.io/webdev-image-gallery/

## Requirements:

- Display at least 12 images on the page in an organized and stylish way (all the same size, aligned, some margin between them, maybe some border or other framing).
Have an effect of some sort when the user hovers over an image (color overlay, outline, resize, or other effect).
- When the user clicks on an image, open it in a large size that covers most of the page. The large image should overlay on top of the image thumbnails.
- When viewing a large version of the image, have a "x" or "close" button that allows the user to close the large image overlay.
- When viewing a large version of the image, have left and right arrow buttons (or "previous" and "next") that the user can click to load the previous or next image.
- You must write your own Javascript!
- Do not use Bootstrap for gallery or carousel features.
- Do not copy more than a few lines of code from any online source.
- You can use bootstrap just for basic styling or the grid system.
